CMF2IMF converts Creative Labs' CMF music files into id Software's IMF format.
It supports both type-0 and type-1 formats, as well as custom playback speeds.

Usage:

  # 560Hz type-0 (Commander Keen)
  cmf2imf --speed 560 --type 0 in.cmf out.imf

  # 700Hz type-1 (Wolfenstein)
  cmf2imf --speed 700 --type 1 in.cmf out.wlf

Most IMF players will treat .imf files as 560Hz and .wlf files as 700Hz.  Duke
Nukem II files run at 280Hz.  See the ModdingWiki IMF page (link below) for
a list of games and the speed of their IMF files.

The speed is not stored in the IMF, so changing it to speed up or slow down
the song will have no ill-effects - it just means that matching the --speed
option to the game will cause the IMF file to play at exactly the same tempo
as the original CMF.

The utility is compiled and installed in the usual way:

  ./configure && make
  sudo make install

If you downloaded the git release, run ./autogen.sh before the commands above.

The program requires the libgamecommon library to be installed.  This library
is available from http://www.shikadi.net/camoto/libgamecommon/

Both the CMF and IMF formats are fully documented on the ModdingWiki - see

This program is released under the GPLv3 license.
